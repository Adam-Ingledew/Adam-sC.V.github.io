									<p class="game-article">
										Games have been a part of my life for in its entirety. I do need to thank them for improving a few aspects of my life skills too. Playing them has given me a better reaction time for most situations. They gave me more critical thinking for problem solving and team work. Also, I must say they have always been a brilliant way to just enjoy some of my spare time.
									</p>
									<p class="medieval">
										History has always been a big part of mine, especially as an Englishman. I find history brilliant in all its woe and glory. This land has seen much strife and in some of my spare time I attend historical reenactments just for the grande spectical. I do hope to become part of this profession at some point in my later life.
									</p>

									<p class="archery">
										Archery was a hobby of mine before I had to quit it due to expenses. This does go hand in hand with my love for history, but this is the part that I really find fascinating. As English and Welsh long-bowmen were revered throughout the European continent for their skill. I had taken up the profession as a hobby. I must say, it takes a lot of skill and a lot of strength when you reach the bows that have 70lbs and above draw weights.
									</p>
									<p class="coding">
										When working through Jepsons I was always thinking of ways to improve myself. One way that stood out was coding and I feel like it fits me like a charm. I have made this website all by myself, and I'm proud that I made it too. I am continuing to work on it and also improve my talent in HTML, CSS and Javascript among other languages. It will be a skill that will hopfully serve me well in the years to come. As I work I also try to accumulate as much up to date knowledge of the whole topic too.
